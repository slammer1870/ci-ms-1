Code Institute Milestone 1 Project

## User Experience
The purpose of this website is to be a single landing page desinged to provide the user with succinct explaination of the product with features and basic configuration details, an iframe for demoing the software and a contact form within a modal for a clean user journey.

- ### User Goals
The fundamental experiences we seek to provide are:
1. Minimal ambiguitity in terms of the product, features and usage. Clear, well articulated copy that is easy to read.
2. Ease of navigation, hence the single page with the contact form in a modal to incentivise form usage without any other distractions on the page.
3. A basic demo of the product for users to familiarise themselves with the look and feel of the product.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme is based around off-whites and dark greys with Bootstrap's standard blue used for interactive elements like submit buttons.
